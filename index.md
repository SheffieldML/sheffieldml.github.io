ML@SITraN is the portion of the machine learning group based at the
Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience. We focus on machine
learning methodological challenges with a particular interest in solving
problems in computational biology and personalized health.

We are part of the [Department of Computer
Science](http://www.shef.ac.uk/dcs/) and the [Department of
Neuroscience](http://www.shef.ac.uk/neuroscience/) at the [University of
Sheffield](http://www.shef.ac.uk).

Major research themes in the ML group include:

-   Personalized Health
-   Computational systems biology
-   Gaussian Processes
-   Approximate inference

The group is always interested in good candidates for [research
